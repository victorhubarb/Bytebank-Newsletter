# Bytebank Newsletter

Newsletter project created for a bank.

## Project Description

Newsletter project for email marketing created with the aim of developing a newsletter that can be viewed by different types of devices, such as cell phones, computers, tablets, and also various possible software. In this project, the most used email services in the world were evaluated and then a newsletter was created so that the view is not affected by any type of permission of the service itself, for example, we can use Gmail as well as Outlook 2003, not having any newsletter change even though Outlook no longer supports many HTML tags. A somewhat ugly project, because good practices are left aside so that the visualization is not compromised, but the objective was successfully executed.
